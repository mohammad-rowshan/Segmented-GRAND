Description: 
This is an implementation of the segmented GRAND algorithm with a simulator for eBCH code (128,106) in Python. The two-level integer partitioning functions can be used for any code. 
The simulator provides additional statistics such as time per query and decoding, average number of queries per decoding, etc.

The algorithm might be confusing. Please read the paper carefully and if you still do not understand it, feel free to contact me via email address mrowshan at ieee dot org

You can find the script for conventional ORBGRAND and the constrained ORBGRAND (all in one file) at https://github.com/mohammad-rowshan/Constrained-Error-Pattern-Generation-for-GRAND which is based on the following paper:
