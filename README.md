Description: 
This is an implementation of the segmented GRAND algorithm ith simulator for eBCH code (128,106) in Python. The two level integer partitioing functions can be used for any code. 
The simulator provides additiona lstatistics such as time per query and decoding, block error rate (BER), bit error rate (BLER), average number of queries ber decoding, etc.

The algorithm might be confusing. Please read the paper carefully and if you still did not understand it, feel free to contact me unsing email address mrowshan at ieee dot org
